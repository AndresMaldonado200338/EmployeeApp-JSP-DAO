>- The file `schema-MySql.sql` located in `src/main/resources` contains the necessary operations to create the schema and the table in the database.

## :gear: Database Configuration

1. Create a database in MySQL to store employee data.
2. In the file `EmployeeDAOImpl` located at `src/main/java/edu/uptc/swii/employeeapp/service/EmployeeDAOImpl.java`, modify the `USER` and `PASSWORD` variables with your MySQL database credentials.

   ```java
    private static final String USER = "your_user";
    private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password";

## :gear: Port Configuration

1. Create the `application.properties` file in the `src/main/resources` directory and set the desired port for running the application. Refer to the configuration in the `application-example.properties` file located in the same directory as an example.

## :heavy_check_mark: Running the Project

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the main file `EmployeeappApplication.java` located at `src/main/java/edu/uptc/swii/employeeapp`.

The application will run at the URL `http://localhost:PORT`, where `PORT` is the value you configured earlier in the `application.properties` file.
